Leaves twirl and fall, 
Grasping autumn close, 
And I hold this poem deep.

Recalling a summer’s sunrise, 
With sweaty hands, quiet kisses, and whispered vows, 
Fast forwarding to an autumn’s end. 

I see the brown tipped leaves dull,
Like the edges of your broken tears, 
Memory engraved. 

Walking by the brick walls, 
Sandals hitting gum stained greys, 
Echoing a city’s heart-pound. 

The vows now buried in summer’s past, 
Tears once abound, scarce in present sound.
