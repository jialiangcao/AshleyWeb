Dying was never painful in a way,

It’s when grief you face when it cuts. 

Grief is a numb thing at first, 

When he says adieu, 

When she left farewells, 

When they say thank you 

And chime the bells. 

The distant future seems so short,

A touch of fingertips just away, 

My quiet escape seems to sway.

Tis’ a duel with the serpent and I, 

His red scales sharpening every thought, 

glimmers of hope for a life fought,

blinks away in sorrow’s bind.
