All she sees are shivering fall leaves,\
And sweltering rays twinkling over eventide,\
Somewhere the tears trickle — she grieves,\
And her memories shown blear-eyed.\
Across a sea of shining sterling swords,\
His golden complexion she takes,\
Made him a lord she adores,\
Trying to keep him away from the fake,\
From so called feigning horse city.\
Why so that he die?\
He couldn’t from men of fifty.\
Eternal mortality she could’ve provide,\
His heel her nemesis,\
Her name Thetis.
