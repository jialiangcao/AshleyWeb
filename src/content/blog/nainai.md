Dying was never painful in a way,
It’s when grief you face when it cuts. 

Grief is a numb thing at first, 
When he says adieu, 
When she left farewells, 
When they say thank you 
And chime the bells. 

The distant future seems so short,
A touch of fingertips just away, 
My quiet escape seems to sway.

Tis’ a duel with the serpent and I, 
His red scales sharpening every thought, 
glimmers of hope for a life fought,
blinks away in sorrow’s bind.
I can still remember the pink sunset glow,
My perambulated walk home slow, 
My sigh full in nostalgia’s flow. 

I saw the half moon peaking up today,
Like the ice cubes prickling up the back,
the back of my neck.

My eyes pulsing with my heart. 
They’re so bleary, 
They’re falling, 
Only I,
Only I was picking them up. 

I remember, 
everyone was so happy, 
So happy. 
I was happy for them. 

Yet my tears unbound, 
And I feel like I'll drown,
My eyes falling, 
I feel like I’m rushing. 

Losing her was so unforeseen, 
Her silky black hair still slipping away from my fingers, 
A memory so keen. 

Just three inches left in my left. 
I remember holding it when I was falling asleep,
At the age of two.
Oh, I can never forget. 
I hold this close with regret. 

Losing her was so grey,
A somber hue. 
My little feet recalls the soil, 
The soil that was her home. 
The soil where dreams grew. 

Among fig trees and fine grapes we flew, 
At the age of two, 
Barefoot, the skies so blue 

The sweet smell of summer’s after rain, lingers yet. 
I can never forget. 
The tear stains on my blue jacket, 
just a silhouette, 
The day she died. 

Now the half moon is peaking up, 
As I walk home to my last night. 
Everyone was so happy but I can never  be. 

I can never be happy without her, 
Maybe my rush can finally end,
Maybe now I can see her again.
